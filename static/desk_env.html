                <p>GNOME is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like operating
                  systems. GNOME was originally an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment, but the acronym
                  was dropped because it no longer reflected the vision of the GNOME project. GNOME is developed by
                  The GNOME Project, which is composed of both volunteers and paid contributors, the largest corporate
                  contributor being Red Hat.</p>

                <p>It is an international project that aims to develop software frameworks
                  for the development of software, to program end-user applications based on these frameworks, and to
                  coordinate efforts for internationalization and localization and accessibility of that software.</p>

                <p>GNOME 3 is the default desktop environment on many major Linux distributions
                  including Fedora,
                  Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Pop! _OS, Oracle Linux,
                  Endless OS, and Tails; as well as Solaris, a Unix operating system. The continued fork of the last
                  GNOME 2 release, called MATE, is default on many Linux distros that target low usage of system
                  resources.</p>

                <h2 class="card-title">KDE Desktop Environment</h2>
                <p>KDE stands for K Desktop Environment. It is a desktop environment for Linux based
                  operation system. You can think KDE as a GUI for Linux OS. KDE has proved Linux users to make it use
                  as easy as they use windows. KDE provides Linux users a graphical interface to choose their own
                  customized desktop environment. You can choose your Graphical Interface among various available GUI
                  interfaces that have their own look.</p>

                <p>You can imagine Linux without KDE and GNOME just like DOS in windows. KDE and GNOME are much similar
                  with Windows except they are related to Linux through x server rather then operation system. When
                  you install Linux you have a choice to choose your own desktop environment from two or three
                  different desktop environments like KDE and GNOME. Another popular environment same as KDE is GNOME.
                  Both come with variety of features with different distributions.</p>

                <p>Xfce or XFCE is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and
                  Unix-like operating systems. Xfce aims to be fast and lightweight while still being visually
                  appealing and easy to use. Xfce embodies the traditional Unix philosophy of modularity and
                  re-usability.</p>
